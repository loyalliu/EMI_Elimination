# Robust EMI Elimination via K-Space Convolution

## Recommended Setup
- The demo script has been tested on MATLAB 2020b running on Windows 10. It is not compatible with MATLAB Online, MATLAB for Linux, or MATLAB for Mac.

## Demo and Sample Data
- A MATLAB demo script is provided for EMI elimination using k-space convolution:
  - `demo_EMI_Elimination`: Demo script for loading the sample data, eliminating EMI using rEDITER, sEDITER, or TEE, and performing image reconstruction.
- A set of sample data is included:
  - `sample_part1.mat`, `sample_part2.mat`, ...: The sample data is divided into five parts to comply with GitHub's file size limits.
